## Description
Frequently, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born. Luckily for us, we will be able to take the user's birthday and calculate the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender output their Akan Name.

## Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
This webpage is documented and designed around the behavior a user expects to experience when interacting with it.

- When the user enters the valid input on the form, the day they were born and their respective Akan name should be actioned.
- When the user adds an invalid input, an alert message should pop up.
- The user should be able to regenerate the form to try out different data from the first input.
